# Portfolio 
Welcome to my portfolio! Here, you'll find a selection of coding projects that I have personally developed and brought to life. While I've had the pleasure of collaborating with talented individuals such as UX designers or using existing APIs in some of these projects, all the code showcased here is solely my own work (with few exceptions). For more information and demonstrations, please visit the respective directories of each project.

# Projects

## [Cooldown Companion](https://github.com/wbigert/portfolio/tree/main/cooldown-companion) [Hobby project]
Skills: **Python, BeautifulSoup, Google Cloud API, MongoDB, Discord.py**

Real-time verbal assistance in the game League of Legends using a Python Client and a Discord Bot. I built this for fun and as a way for me and my friends to improve our  performance while playing the game together. It can be used simultaneously by all players in your team, as long as you are in the same Discord Voice channel.

## [Java Game Engine](https://github.com/wbigert/portfolio/tree/main/java-game-engine) [Hobby project]
Skills: **Java, Java Foundation Libraries (AWT and Swing)**

A 2D game engine that I built from scratch using core Java libraries during the summer of 2020 with the sole purpose of improving my Java skills.

## [Nexus](https://github.com/wbigert/portfolio/tree/main/nexus) [Project for Studs 2023]
Skills: **React, TypeScript, CSS, HTML, Bootstrap**

The new Studs website as of 2023. As member of IT in KTH Studs 2023, I picked the rather ambitious project of creating a new website using modern libraries such as **React 18.2** and **Vite 4.0.1**. I collaborated with the UX-designers of Studs 2023 and refurbished the backend API built by previous generations of Studs.

## [Team Metrics](https://github.com/wbigert/portfolio/tree/main/team-metrics) [Project for TellusTalk AB]
Skills: **Python, NumPy, Pandas, PIL, MatPlotLib, Seaborn, MongoDB, Discord.py**

A data collection tool with report generation and data visualization I built during my time at TellusTalk AB. Assists developers and interns working remotely by simplifying the session logging process.
