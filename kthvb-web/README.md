KTH Volleyball is the largest sports association of KTH and receives hundreds of applicants for their tryouts. Keeping track of every applicant's performance during tryouts and mentally connecting their names and numbers with faces is incredibly difficult. To solve this problem, I developed a tool that, first, automatically adds Google Form applications to a database. If logged in, the applicants can then be viewed and edited via the website (see [https://kthvb.wbigert.com/applicants](https://kthvb.wbigert.com/applicants) for tech demo). Further, and most importantly, team members assessing the tryoutees can use a mobile-friendly page to take pictures of applicants as they arrive at the hall, and then give feedback on their performance live as they play (see [https://kthvb.wbigert.com/tryouts](https://kthvb.wbigert.com/tryouts) for tech demo). As a result, we have pictures and feedback of every applicant to discuss after the tryouts.
