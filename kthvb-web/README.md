The KTH-Volleyball Association website.

The website visible to externals is a simple static information website which you can visit yourself at [https://kthvolleyball.com](https://kthvolleyball.com).

However, the fun begins once you actually have administrator rights and hook the website up to our Tryouts Google Forms Excel Sheet. I will demo it in this ReadMe using videos and pictures.

KTH Volleyball is the largest sports association of KTH and receives hundreds of applicants for their tryouts. Keeping track of every applicant's performance during tryouts and mentally connecting their names and numbers with faces is incredibly difficult. To solve this problem, I developed a tool that, first, automatically adds Google Form applications to a database. If logged in, the applicants can then be viewed and edited via https://kthvolleyball.com/applicants. Further, and most importantly, team members assessing the tryoutees can use the mobile-friendly page  https://kthvolleyball.com/tryouts to take pictures of applicants as they arrive at the hall, and then give feedback on their performance live as they play. As a result, we have pictures and feedback of every applicant to discuss after the tryouts.
